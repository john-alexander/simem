Description: The siMEM (si/shRNA Interference Mixed Effects Model) algorithm predicts
        differential essentiality from pooled phenotypic screens. Such screens typically
        have multiple reagents (e.g., shRNAs, gRNAs) targeting each gene, and are
        performed across multiple, genetically heterogeneous, cell lines/samples.
        The algorithm is detailed in Marcotte et al. 2016 ("The Functional Genomic
        Landscape of Human Breast Cancer Drivers, Vulnerabilities and Resistances.").
        Pooled screen data formatted for use with the siMEM algorithm can be found
